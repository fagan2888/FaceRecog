# FaceRecog
FaceRecognition.py sets up all the functions including the classifiers. You need to go through them to understand basic Haar Cascades and LBPH Classifier. 
Training.py takes care of the implementation part. 
While running, run training.py after installing OpenCV. 
The paths for the image and the HaarCascade Classifiers need to be changed based upon respective system configurations.
